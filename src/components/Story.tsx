            Small clubs are the heartbeat of grassroots sports, but they often make do with 
            WhatsApp groups, shared Excel sheets, and good intentions. We believe they 
            deserve better â€” not enterprise software, but something crafted with care.

            Grassroot started as a love letter to every volunteer coach who manages teams 
            on their phone, every club secretary juggling member lists, and every treasurer 
            collecting fees with a smile and a prayer.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Today, clubs can create activities, manage members, and collect payments 
            in a clean, accessible app that just works on mobile. It's stable, it's 
            human, and it's ready for the teams that make sports wonderful.
